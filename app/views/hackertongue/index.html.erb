<h3>Give us a github user, and we'll give you languages!</h3>

<p>This is a fun project to determine the favourite programming languages of
a Github user. Enter a Github username below and we will try and find that out for you.</p>

<h4>CAVEATS</h4>

<p>We can handle 5000 requests per hour to the Github API right now. When someone uses this form and we grab a hacker's fave lingo, we persist it and that way we can build up a collection of hackers by language and get the data back to you faster.</p>

<!--<p>Most popular language in our database right now: <em id="top"><%= @most_popular %></em></p>-->

<%= form_tag language_path do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :username, params[:username], placeholder: "Github username" %>
  <%= submit_tag 'Go!' %>
<% end %>
